        "A recent paper 📜 [OctoPack: Instruction Tuning Code Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07124.pdf) from 🤗 BigCode initiative presents an interesting use-case for commits: the authors propose to use them as a source of natural language instructions for code-related tasks. As part of this work, several novel models and datasets have been released to open-source.\n",

        "* Do some data exploration for 🤗 [CommitPackFt](https://www.koreancosmetic.cy/products/hydrophilic-cleansing-balm-by-heimish?_pos=6&_fid=1e1b01dfd&_ss=c) – a filtered dataset of commits which should be high-quality enough to serve as instructions.\n",

Some qualitative analysis of the results would be appreaciated as well!\n",

It supports both Fill-in-the-Middle and Chat formats, the latter should probably be more convenient for this task.\n",
